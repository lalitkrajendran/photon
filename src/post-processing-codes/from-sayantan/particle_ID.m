%
% [p_matrix,peaks,num_p]=particle_ID_MAIN_V1(im,particleIDprops);
%
% This is a MAIN function for particle identification and segmentation from
% grayscale images.  It calls several differet sub-functions (contained
% below) depending the image parameters, specifically the particle image
% density.  For sparse-to-medium seeding densities, the 'blob' method is
% recommended.  For a densly seeded image, with many overlapped particle
% images, the 'dynamic' method is recommended.  The combined method is a
% beta-version and should be used with caution since it has not been
% rigorly tested
%
% INPUTS
%    im1,im2 - image to be processesed; should be uint8
%    particleIDprops - processing parameters related to particle ID
%        particleIDprops.method - selects the ID/segmentation method
%            'blob','dynamic','combined'
%        particleIDprops.v - base thresholding for the image
%        particleIDprops.contrast_ratio - ratio of max particle intensity to
%            possible pixel intensity, used to limit the intensity range a
%            particle can expand from its max value ('dynamic' only)
%            *typically set to 0, higher values can reduce processing time*
%        particleIDprops.save_dir - saveing filepath; make '0' if not saving
%        particleIDprops.slsh - '\' or '/' (PC or Linux)
%        particleIDprops.s_name - base saving name
%        particleIDprops.s_num - saving number
%
% OUTPUTS
%    p_matrix (2D array) - matrix of particle identification and extent
%    peaks (2D array) - matrix of identified image peaks (by image erosion)
%    num_p (num) - number of identified particles in p_matrix
